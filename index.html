            <p> “Brilliant people shine more brightly than ordinary ones. They never regret or agonize over what they’ve done.”</p>
            <p>“Is it really worth saving this sad and ugly world, when there is nothing left after it is saved? With all this death, cruelty and sadness, do you still want to become a hero?”</p>
            <p>“You can certainly fulfill your wish to “save someone”. But a wish for you to save yourself, does not exist. You will embrace a borrowed ideal that is not yours, and you will probably pursue it until you die."</p>
            <p>“Do not think about other things, there is only one thing you can do. So master that one thing. Do not forget. What you must imagine is always that you, yourself, are the strongest. You do not need outside enemies. For you, the one you have to fight is none other than your own image.”</p>
